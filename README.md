This module contains an implementation of a flow page section repeater.

It overrides the basic CHART container component.

It allows attaching a list to a container and for each element in that list the child elements of the container will be repeated per list item.

## Functionality

When working on a list of values and each one needs to be presented as a repeating block of Flow Page then this module gives that functionality.

Like a table but a repeating page section, designed in the standard page designer.

Any page container defined as CHART layout will be hijacked and replaced with this new class.

The container should have an attribute named "ListName" which contains the name of a list value in Flow containing 0-many objects

The repeated child elements are simply copied, as is, and added to the page tied to the fields of the current list item.



## Component Attributes

### classes

Like all components, adding a "classes" attribute will cause that string to be added to the base container's class value

### ListName

Applied as an attribute on the base repeating container.

Tells the container where to get its list of values to repeat.

The developerName of the list.

### FieldName

Applied at the page component level.

Tells the component which attribute of the list item to present.

Just the attribute name excluding the parent object.

If the repeating list object itself contains a complex object with attributes then you can specify this with attributeName->childAttributeName adding the arrow separator "->"
